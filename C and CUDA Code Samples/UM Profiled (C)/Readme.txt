This specific project was the creation of a universal machine in C where we were given sets of 
opcodes and were to emulate them in C code. This UM was able to run .um files, 
similarly to a dos machine.

The result is a type of "Virtual Machine" that is a simple C-based emulator which can run any code for similarly 
designed "Universal Machine"
