First Project: Cell Culture Project
•	Description
o	The project is a first-person and virtual reality simulation for training Pharmacy students in proper lab safety and the processes to properly culture the cell using all the necessary parts.
•	Work Summary
o	The work was split between me and a coworker we worked together developing the project, we were both equally involved in developing the simulation, additionally I oversaw modeling all the models used in the simulation. Both versions were developed simultaneously so that any changes immediately apply to both versions.
•	Plug-ins and Additions
o	The main plugin involved in the project was SteamVR with the use of its OpenVR Loader, in addition to an outlining plugin. SteamVR allowed us to quickly implement VR and added interactions to create a complex interaction system.
•	Work type
o	Remote development and On-Site Testing

Second Project: Kidney Nephron Diuretic Mechanisms
•	Description
o	The project is a first-person and virtual reality simulation for teaching Pharmacy students the action of diuretics within the nephrons of the kidney, by placing the user into an example cell, where the player manually carries out transporting ions through proteins. Each example cell is a different component of the nephron and has different transport proteins.
•	Work Summary
o	This project was fully developed by me, except for the initial quiz design. From the initial quiz design, I had to add additional features to the quiz to streamline and improve the system. This project was developed in a back-to-front approach where individuals components were developed then tested until they are fully implemented then once all the components are created, they can be easily drag and dropped in.
•	Plug-ins and Additions
o	Similarly, to the previous project SteamVR was the main plugin used.
•	Work type
o	Remote development and On-Site Testing
