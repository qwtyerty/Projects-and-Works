This folder contains a small selection of scripts and screenshots from my VR Unity projects from work.

This Project belongs to the University of Rhode Island, and premisson was granted to upload a sample of code and images.

This project was headed by me for Dr. Roberta King to have a first person and VR simulation of the use of diuretics within the kidney, 
and have students perform the ion exchange manually.

The initial verson of quiz was created by Frank Annuziato then editted by me into its finalized form. The rest of the project was programmed by me.
